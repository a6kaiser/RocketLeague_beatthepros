ROCKET LEAGUE
Beat The Pros
By Alexandre Kaiser

Rocket League is a very interesting video game to solve because of the mechanical complexity there is to do anything productive in the game. You are navigating a 3-dimensional space using a car with primitive controls (steering, gas, drift, rocket boosters, pitch and roll) to put a ball into a goal.

On top of the mechanical complexity, there exists the same additional complexities that are common to most games:
1. teamwork: spacing and scheme
2. delayed-payoff: difficult to assign value to each decision made

What are my largest concerns about this project:
- latency: the model can not be so complex that it can't make millisecond-accurate decisions (professionals consider 10ms a serious competitive disadvantage)
- hierarchical mechanics: most moves
- coordinating with teammates: the non-trivial nature of team coordination almost adds insult-to-injury with respect to the already complicated nature of 1v1s
